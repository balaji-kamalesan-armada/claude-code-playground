# 👋 Quick Orientation

**New to this playground?** This is a 2-minute overview.

## What's Inside

5 learning modules that teach you how to work effectively with Claude:

```
01-CONTEXT/         → What Claude sees (temporary)
02-MEMORY/          → What Claude remembers (permanent)
03-SESSION-CONTEXT/ → Managing conversations efficiently
04-SKILLS/          → Custom workflows and automation
05-RULES/           → Project coding standards
```

Plus comparison examples:
- **START-REPO** - Poorly documented (demonstrates problems)
- **BEST-REPO** - Well documented (demonstrates solutions)

## Quick Start Paths

### 🚀 10 Minutes - Just the Concepts
Read these two:
1. [01-CONTEXT/README.md](01-CONTEXT/README.md) - What is context?
2. [02-MEMORY/README.md](02-MEMORY/README.md) - What is memory?

Done! Apply immediately to your projects.

### ⭐ 90 Minutes - Focused Learning (RECOMMENDED)
```
1. Context (20 min)     → README.md + EXAMPLES.md
2. Memory (20 min)      → README.md + EXAMPLES.md
3. Rules (20 min)       → README.md + EXAMPLES.md
4. Compare (30 min)     → START-REPO vs BEST-REPO
```

Best balance of speed and depth.

### 📚 4-5 Hours - Complete Mastery
Go through all 5 modules + practice transformation.

## Key Concepts You'll Learn

**CONTEXT** = What Claude sees RIGHT NOW
- Code, comments, files, conversation
- Temporary (only in current view)

**MEMORY** = What Claude remembers FOREVER
- Tech stack, architecture, conventions
- Persistent across all sessions
- Use `/remember` command

**SESSION CONTEXT** = Managing token budgets
- ~200k tokens per session
- Use `/compact` to save space
- Know when to start fresh

**SKILLS** = Custom workflows
- Create slash commands like `/commit`
- Automate repetitive tasks

**RULES** = Coding standards
- Define in `.claude/rules.md`
- Claude follows automatically
- Ensures consistency

## What You Get

**Before:**
- Repeat yourself every session
- Inconsistent code
- Manual workflows
- Claude confused

**After:**
- Zero repetition with memory
- Consistent code with rules
- Automated workflows with skills
- Clear communication with context

**Impact:** 30-50% productivity increase

## Next Step

**→ Go to main [README.md](README.md) and pick your learning path**

That's where you'll find:
- Detailed path options
- Module dependency diagram
- `/remember` and `/compact` usage guides
- Complete learning structure

**Or jump directly to:**
- [Module 1: Context](01-CONTEXT/README.md)
- [Module 2: Memory](02-MEMORY/README.md)
- [Module 5: Rules](05-RULES/README.md)

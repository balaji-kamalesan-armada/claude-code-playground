## Quick Start (30 minutes)

**The fastest path to understanding:**

### Step 1: Learn Context (15 min)
```bash
cd 01-CONTEXT
# Read README.md - what context is
# Do EXERCISE.md - practice adding context
```

### Step 2: Learn Memory (15 min)
```bash
cd 02-MEMORY
# Read README.md - memory vs context
# Do EXERCISE.md - practice /remember
```

**That's it!** You now understand the two most important concepts. 💡

## Module Overview

### Module 1: Context
**Goal:** Understand what Claude sees RIGHT NOW

**Key Learning:** Context = code + comments + files + conversation (temporary)

**Files:**
- `README.md` - Complete guide with examples
- `EXERCISE.md` - Hands-on practice

**Time:** 15 minutes

### Module 2: Memory
**Goal:** Store facts that persist FOREVER

**Key Learning:** Memory ≠ Context (memory persists across sessions)

**Files:**
- `README.md` - Complete guide with examples
- `EXERCISE.md` - Practice `/remember` command

**Time:** 15 minutes

### Module 3: Session Context
**Goal:** Manage conversation history efficiently

**Key Learning:** Strategic session boundaries improve quality

**Exercises:**
- Monitor token usage
- Experience context exhaustion
- Learn when to reset sessions

**Time:** 60 minutes

### Module 4: Skills
**Goal:** Create custom workflows

**Key Learning:** Skills automate repetitive tasks

**Exercises:**
- Use built-in skills
- Create custom skill
- Automate your workflow

**Time:** 60 minutes

### Module 5: Rules
**Goal:** Establish coding standards

**Key Learning:** Rules ensure consistency

**Exercises:**
- See chaos without rules
- Implement with rules
- Measure the difference

**Time:** 60 minutes

Slow       →  →  →  →  →  Fast
Frustration →  →  →  →  →  Productivity
```

## Study Tips

### 1. Learn by Doing
Don't just read - actually do the exercises!

### 2. Take Notes
Document your observations and learnings

### 3. Compare Results
Always compare before/after to see the impact

### 4. Be Patient
Give yourself time to understand each concept

### 5. Experiment
Try variations, test edge cases, explore

### 6. Apply Immediately
Use learnings on your real projects

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to complete all modules?"

**Minimum:** Modules 1, 5, and START/BEST comparison

These give you the foundation. Add others as needed.

### "Can I skip around?"

Yes, but recommended order gives best learning flow.

For quick impact: 1 (Context) → 5 (Rules) → START/BEST

### "How long before I see benefits?"

**Immediate:** After understanding context and rules
**Sustained:** As you apply to real projects
**Compounding:** As your team adopts practices

### "Is this only for Claude?"

Principles apply to all AI assistants, but examples are Claude-specific.

### "What if I get stuck?"

- Re-read the module README
- Look at the examples
- Try the exercise again
- Document what's unclear

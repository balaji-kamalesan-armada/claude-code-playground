## Journey: START → BEST

This playground is designed to help you understand how to effectively work with Claude AI by comparing:
- **START-REPO**: Minimal setup with common pitfalls (demonstrates hallucination, confusion)
- **BEST-REPO**: Optimal setup with best practices (demonstrates clarity, accuracy)

## Learning Modules

### 1. [CONTEXT](01-CONTEXT/README.md) - 15 minutes
**What Claude sees RIGHT NOW**
- Learn what context is (code, comments, files, conversation)
- See examples of low vs high context
- Practice adding context to your code

### 2. [MEMORY](02-MEMORY/README.md) - 15 minutes
**What Claude remembers FOREVER**
- Learn the difference between memory and context
- Set up memory for your projects
- Practice the `/remember` command

### 3. [SESSION CONTEXT](03-SESSION-CONTEXT/README.md)
Master session context management
- Learn about context windows
- Understand token budgets
- Practice context exhaustion scenarios
- Strategies for efficient context usage

### 4. [SKILLS](04-SKILLS/README.md)
Create and use custom skills
- Build reusable workflows
- Create domain-specific helpers
- Integrate custom tools

### 5. [RULES](05-RULES/README.md)
Implement effective rules and guidelines
- **without-rules**: Observe inconsistent behavior
- **with-rules**: Establish clear boundaries and patterns

## Getting Started

1. **Start with START-REPO**: Experience common issues
2. **Work through each module**: Learn concepts progressively
3. **Study BEST-REPO**: See all practices combined
4. **Apply learnings**: Transform START into BEST

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed
- Basic understanding of AI interactions
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment

## Quick Start

**Total Time: ~60 minutes**

```bash
# Step 1: Context (15 min)
cd claude-ai-playground/01-CONTEXT
# Read README.md, do EXERCISE.md

# Step 2: Memory (15 min)
cd ../02-MEMORY
# Read README.md, do EXERCISE.md

# Step 3: Session Context (15 min)
cd ../03-SESSION-CONTEXT
# Read README.md, do exercises

# Step 4: Skills (15 min)
cd ../04-SKILLS
# Read README.md, try examples
```

## Module Structure

Each module now contains **just 2 files**:
- **README.md**: Everything you need to know (concepts + examples)
- **EXERCISE.md**: Hands-on practice (with solutions)

**Simple. Focused. No overwhelm.**

Happy Learning! 🚀

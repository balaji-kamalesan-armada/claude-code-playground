# How To Use This Playground

## What You Have

Two folders with learning materials about Claude AI:

```
01-CONTEXT/          # Learn what Claude sees
02-MEMORY/           # Learn what Claude remembers
```

## How To Use It

### Option 1: Read and Learn (30 minutes)

**Just read the files in order:**

1. **Context (15 min)**
   ```
   cd 01-CONTEXT

   # Read these in order:
   1. README.md - what context is
   2. example-without-context.js - bad example
   3. example-with-context.js - good example
   4. EXERCISE.md - try the exercises
   ```

2. **Memory (15 min)**
   ```
   cd 02-MEMORY

   # Read these in order:
   1. README.md - what memory is
   2. scenario-without-memory.md - the pain
   3. scenario-with-memory.md - the solution
   4. EXERCISE.md - try the exercises
   ```

**That's it!** You now understand context and memory.

### Option 2: Just Read the READMEs (10 minutes)

**Fastest way to get the concepts:**

```bash
# Just open these two files:
01-CONTEXT/README.md    # 5 min read
02-MEMORY/README.md     # 5 min read
```

**Then apply to your projects!**

---

### Option 3: Do the Exercises (30 minutes)

**Hands-on learning:**

```bash
# 1. Open Claude Code CLI
# 2. Navigate to the playground folder
# 3. Follow the exercises:

cd 01-CONTEXT
# Do EXERCISE.md with Claude

cd ../02-MEMORY
# Do EXERCISE.md with Claude
```

---

## For Teams

**Share this folder with your team:**

1. Everyone reads the README files (10 min each)
2. Discuss examples in team meeting (30 min)
3. Apply to your team's projects
4. Create team standards based on learnings

---

## What You'll Learn

### From 01-CONTEXT:
- ✅ What context means (code, comments, files, conversation)
- ✅ How to add context to your code
- ✅ Why context matters for Claude

### From 02-MEMORY:
- ✅ What memory is (persistent facts)
- ✅ Memory vs Context difference
- ✅ How to use `/remember` command
- ✅ What to remember (and what not to)

---

## After Learning

**Apply to your projects:**

1. **Add Context** to your code:
   - Use descriptive names
   - Add comments explaining "why"
   - Create README.md files

2. **Use Memory** for your projects:
   ```bash
   /remember Project: [Your project]
   /remember Tech: [Your tech stack]
   /remember Architecture: [Your pattern]
   ```

---

## If You Get Stuck

Just ask Claude:
```
"I'm learning about context from the playground.
Can you explain [specific question]?"
```

---

## That's It!

**Two folders. 8 files. 30 minutes.**

You now know how to work better with Claude! 🎯
